A short one sentence description of your code, such as Gotemplate is a template repository for GitHub go libraries.

# Why

Explain why someone would want to use this code.

Use gotemplate to spin up a new Go library on GitHub, without making it a direct fork.

# Usage

Include usage examples.  These can often be direct copies from your example_test.go file

```go
    func ExampleRemoveMe() {
    	gotemplate.RemoveMe()
    }
```

To use gotemplate, follow the instructions on [github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-template-repository).

# Contributing

Tell people how they can contribute.  Start with something simple and create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file if you really
need it.

Contributions welcome!  Submit a pull request on github and make sure your code passes `make lint test`.  For
large changes, I strongly recommend creating an issue on GitHub first to confirm your change will be accepted before
writing a lot of code.
